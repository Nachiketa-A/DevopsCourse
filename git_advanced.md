## Branching strategy

### These are 3 branches : Master, staging, Dev

#### To check which branch is present: git branch

#### To switch or change the branch: git checkout branch name or git switch branch name

#### To get log in proper manner: git log --oneline

#### To revert a commit: git revert commit_id

#### To reset commit: git reset commit_id
