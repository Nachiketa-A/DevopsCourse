#### 1)What is Ansible?

**Ans:** Ansible is a powerful open-source automation tool used for configuration management, application deployment, and orchestration in DevOps workflows.:

In Ansible we simply needs to write Playbooks which is written in YAML and using that playbook we can manage configurations of all the machines.

There are two terms in Ansible:

**1.Control Node**: The machine in which we installed Ansible is called as Control Node.Using that one machine we can manage configuartion of all other machines.


**2.Manage Node**: Machines which are managed by control Node are known as Manage Nodes.
