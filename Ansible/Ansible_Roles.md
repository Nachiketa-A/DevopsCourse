#### Ansible Roles

An Ansible role is a reusable, self-contained unit of automation that is used to organize and manage tasks, variables, files, templates, and handlers in a structured way.

Roles help to encapsulate and modularize the logic and configuration needed to manage a particular system or application component.

This modular approach promotes reusability, maintainability, and consistency across different playbooks and environments.

**To create roles we use command:ansible-galaxy role init test**
