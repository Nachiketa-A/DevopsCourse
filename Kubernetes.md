# Kubernetes Fundamentals

If we need to do auto scaling, auto update we use Kubernetes.

Kubernetes is now part of bigger project called Cloud Native Computing Foundation(CNCF).


Kubernetes is a powerful open-source container orchestration platform  used in DevOps and containerized application environments.

It simplifies the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications by providing a unified platform for automating the deployment, 

scaling, and operations of application containers across clusters of hosts.
