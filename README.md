Kernel: Kernel is a heart of linux.

Shell: Shell is the doorway from which user can interact with kernel and kernel  can interact  with  hardware.

We can directly work with the shell or we can connect the shell with applications and utilities.

In simple terms:- We install applications and utilities and to use this we write some commands through shell and then shell interact
                  with kernel then kernel interact with hardware.
